        <p class="bio">
          My research focuses on developing fairness strategies for supervised machine learning models. 
          I explore how ethical principles and social justice can be integrated into the evaluation and 
          deployment of machine learning models. My work aims to identify, measure, and mitigate biases 
          to promote more equitable outcomes. I am also interested in developing methods to detect 
          discrimination and assess fairness in facial recognition systems. My research interests include 
          ethics, justice, and the social impact of machine learning and artificial intelligence.

    <h3>FolIA</h3>
    <p>
      A personal project for an artificial intelligence agent developed to offer personalized support to revelers during Carnival in Recife and Olinda. FoLIA helps users create optimized itineraries based on their interests (such as free bloco parties, VIP boxes, children's sections), their origin location, and the number of bloco parties they want. The project was developed with a focus on accessibility, organization, and safety, promoting a more relaxed, free, and personalized Carnival experience.
