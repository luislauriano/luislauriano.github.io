          My research focuses on developing fairness strategies for supervised machine learning models. 
          I explore how ethical principles and social justice can be integrated into the evaluation and 
          deployment of machine learning models. My work aims to identify, measure, and mitigate biases 
          to promote more equitable outcomes. I am also interested in developing methods to detect 
          discrimination and assess fairness in facial recognition systems. My research interests include 
          ethics, justice, and the social impact of machine learning and artificial intelligence.
